I just got a Kindle Paperwhite that supports Audible. At first I had no luck connecting it to bluetooth.

The error was something along the lines of 'Could not connect to bluetooth device "AirPods"'.

The fix was simple.

1. Hold the power button of the kindle for 40 seconds (or until the device begins to reboot automatically).
2. Ensure both Airpods are in its case.
3. Open the lid of the Airpods case.
4. Press the button on the back of the Airpods case until a light continuously flashes white.
5. Add the bluetooth device as normal with the Kindle.

It should work now!
