### 1

Step one is to head on over to the [Private Internet Access download page](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/download).

That'll give you a `.run` file. Save it to your ~/Downloads directory.

### 2

Open up a terminal, cd to your Downloads directory, and make the `.run` file executable.

```
chmod +x pia-linux-x.x.x-xxxxx.run
```

### 3

Before running the installer, we are going to create two symbolic links so the PIA installer does not complain. Solus is structured a bit differently than most other Linux distributions.

```
sudo ln -s /usr/bin /usr/local/bin 
sudo ln -s /usr/share/defaults/iproute2/ /etc/iproute2
```

### 4

Run the file in your terminal and follow through the install instructions. Should go smoothly without errors.

```
./pia-linux-x.x.x-xxxxx.run
```

### 5

Here's the tricky part that took me hours to figure out.

First, Private Internet Access currently relies on net-tools (primarily netstat. Also ifconfig (which is installed on Solus) and route). Now, the problem here is that net-tools is a deprecated set of utilities and Solus, being ahead of the curve, removed it from their repositories early. No worries, we can still install it.

First, install some utilities.

```
sudo eopkg it -c system.devel
sudo eopkg it git
```

Now we will install net tools.

```
cd /opt
sudo git clone https://github.com/ecki/net-tools.git
cd net-tools
sudo make # Press enter a bunch of times when asked the questions
sudo make install
```

Almost there! Now you should have net-tools installed. To confirm, type `netstat --version`.

### 6

The final step is to create two more symlinks.

```
sudo ln -s /bin/ifconfig
sudo ln -s /bin/route /sbin/route
```

You should be able to connect to the PIA VPN with ease now. Enjoy!
