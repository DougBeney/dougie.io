## Notes

### Providing support in IRC & forums

There are [plenty](https://www.slant.co/topics/1323/~irc-clients-for-linux) of lightweight IRC clients. You could connect to the channel of your favorite project, leave it running in the background, and check on it every once and a while to see if someone needs help.

With forums, espsecially reddit, there's always someone that could use your expertise.
