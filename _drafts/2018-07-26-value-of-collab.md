You create an email and send it to a fellow blogger.

    **SUBJECT: LOVE your blog!!**
    Hello, person!
    I LOVE your blog.
    I am a blogger too and wrote about some topic.
    Mind if I send you over a link?


    **SUBJECT: Re: LOVE your blog!!**
    Hi,
    Sure. Send it over.


    **SUBJECT: Re: Re: Love your blog!!**
    EPIC!!!!
    Here it is xyz.com/some-blogpost
    Also, I think it would be a great resource
    to include in YOUR blog post.

...Crickets.

This is the typical link-building approach used by most SEOs.

It works at scale. You'll always get some people to link to your content. However, there is one fundamental problem with it.

You are relying on the generosity of others. What's in it for them? Not much. Maybe your link will be helpful to some of their readers, but it's not some major article improvement. You're the only winner in this situation.

This is where the value of collaboration comes in. You scratch my back I'll scratch yours.

## The Symbiotic Relationship

The most widely-known symbiotic relationship is that of a bird - the Egyptian plover bird - and the crocodile.

That crocodile could easily crunch down on at least two of those birds and get a decent lunch but it doesn't. Those birds are providing a valuable service to the croc.

## Ways to create a mutual collaboration

### Identifying your leverage (Assets)

The first step to brainstorming collaboration ideas is to get an idea of what leverage you have - what assets you control:

- Social media following?
- Email list?
- Specially curated email (Example: A newsletter that sends out NOTHING except for special deals & coupons on pet supplies)
- A blog readership?
- A wealth of articles in which you could find places to mention the creations of the person you're outreaching to.

### Identifying your services

Maybe you don't have a large following or even a regular readership. There are still services you could provide to others in order to get whatever you're aiming for. - a link, a mention on a "Top X [things]" article, what have you.

- **Improving an article**. Let's say there's an article about the most popular marketing trends. It hasn't been updated for a while and it seems the owner of the site is busy with other things. You could mention that you are interested in helping him update the article. You could provide examples of you writing (In the second email. The first email needs to be short and to the point). You also need to make it clear that you're helping him out because you want are promoting [some article] and feel that it could be a great resource to include in the updated guide.
- **Giving the owner a vacation from social media**. This only works if the person you're outreaching to is not a company with a dedicated social media team and if you could convince them that you would actually do a good job.
