Something that I have learned is how important it is to start out your mornings doing your most important work.

This is not a time that is wisely utilized for personal projects and web browsing.

I tend to have the most energy at around 0800-1100.

The night before, it can help to plan out tomorrow's most important activities.

Something that I am going to try is getting out the hardest or most tedious work at the very beginning of the day. I will try to keep things that excite me closer to the end of the day.

The idea behind this is that:

1. Even if you don't have your full energy later in the day, passion can help you push through.
2. Getting important work immediately instead of doing pleasure activities helps you build up momentum.
