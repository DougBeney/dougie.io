## Creating a self-signed SSL Certificate

### First create an RSA key

`openssl genrsa 2048 > foo.key`

### Then, create a certificate signing request

`openssl req -new -key ./foo.key > foo.csr`

### And finally create the certificate

`openssl x509 -req -in foo.csr -out foo.crt -signkey ./2048.key -days 365`

*Note: `-req` tells openssl that this is a certificate request that should sign and output*

## Creating a self-signed certificate in less commands.

There are many different ways to generate keys. Here is another way.

[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-postfix-e-mail-server-with-dovecot) accomplished the same tasks but in two commands instead.

### Generate the private key and certificate

`openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout foo.key -out foo.crt`

### Generate the certificate signing request

`openssl req -new -key foo.key -nodes -days 365 -out foo.csr`
