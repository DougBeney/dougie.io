I will learn about one new cryptocurrency every day for at least 30 days.

## GALA

**Where I heard about it:** Binance 'Top Movers' of the day

Blockchain game company.

"We believe the blockchain should be invisible in our games. We use simple game mechanics that all players can enjoy, whether or not they consider themselves to be blockchain pros."

GALA is their Ethereum token.

## Shiba Token

Much like Dogecoin, Shiba is a meme coin.

It's biggest difference between itself and Dogecoin is that Dogecoin is a Bitcoin fork. It has its own blockchain, miners and nodes. Shiba is an Ethereum Token.

SHIB is their main currency. It started with a supply of one quadrillion. Then the founder gave 50% of that to Uniswap, a decentralized crypto exchange. Also Vitalik Buterin burned 410 trillion tokens.

In addition to that, they also have **LEASH** which supposedly has "rewards" but there [hasn't been any so far it seems](https://www.reddit.com/r/SHIBADULTS/comments/onz4gi/leash_rewards/). It has a very limited supply of "107,646 tokens".

Its last token is **BONE**. It has 250 million tokens. The main purpose of this is a governance token. Owning BONE would give you the ability to vote on decisions regarding the Shiba projects thanks to their [Doggy DAO](https://blog.shibaswap.com/doggy-dao-is-here-woof-3/).

Its main advantage over Dogecoin is that they have an ecosystem around them - the 3 tokens with different benefits, their NFT project(s) such as Shiba Artist Incubator, [their metaverse endeavors](https://blog.shibaswap.com/shib-the-metaverse-canyon-first-concept-art-reveal/). Being a token instead of a fork of a coin gives the developers less technical debt (having to maintain/update code for a blockchain, dealing with miners nodes). Instead, they let Ethereum focus on that and they just maintan their token's contract code. It's community run thanks to the DAO. The stronger the community is, the more they could branch out.
